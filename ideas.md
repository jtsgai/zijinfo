  **Design Movement**: Corporate Modernism / International Style

  **Color Philosophy**: 
    - Primary: Deep Navy Blue (#0A2342) - Represents stability, depth, and corporate authority.

    - Content is organized in clean, structured cards with subtle borders, reflecting the organized nature of management consulting.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - **Golden Geometric Lines**: Thin, elegant gold lines used as dividers or background accents to guide the eye and suggest "pathways" or "connections".

  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Assured Precision".
    - Hover effects are subtle and smooth (e.g., a card lifting slightly with a shadow increase).
    - No bouncy or chaotic animations. Everything feels deliberate and weighted.
  **Animation**:
    - **Fade-in Up**: Content sections slide gently upwards while fading in.
    - **Parallax Scrolling**: Subtle movement of background cityscapes relative to foreground content to create depth.
  **Typography System**:
    - **Headings**: Playfair Display (Serif) - For a touch of elegance and authority.
    - **Body**: Lato (Sans-Serif) - For high readability and a modern corporate feel.

## Selected Approach
**Design Movement**: Corporate Modernism / International Style (Response 1)

**Reasoning**: This style best aligns with the client's profile as a Singapore-based enterprise management consulting firm. The combination of Navy Blue and Gold perfectly captures the "Zijin" (Purple/Gold) brand identity while maintaining a high level of corporate professionalism. The "International Style" reflects their role as a bridge for cross-border business. The use of Singapore landmarks (Marina Bay Sands, etc.) fits naturally with this aesthetic. It conveys trust, authority, and premium service, which is essential for a consultancy dealing with strategy, finance, and compliance.

**Implementation Plan**:
- **Colors**: Navy Blue (#0A2342), Gold (#D4AF37), White/Grey.
- **Fonts**: Playfair Display (Headings), Lato (Body).
- **Visuals**: High-quality images of Singapore skyline (already provided) with gold geometric overlays.
- **Layout**: Clean, card-based sections for services, split-screen hero section.
